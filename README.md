3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) 
4. **Extracted, Transformed, and Loaded (ETL)** - transformed data from JupyterLab to CSV files for loading into the Tableau environment
5. **Tableau Dashboard** - Created an interactive dashboard using joins, calculated fields and visual design techniques to highlight key insights on company performances
